  <h2>Free and Open Source Link Sharing</h2>

Linkr is currently (temporarily) live at [Python Anywhere](https://adamtherookie.pythonanywhere.com).

## What is Linkr
Linkr is a link sharer, meaning you have one link (your Linkr) that you post on your social media profiles which then contains all the other links you have: personal websites, stores, content...

## Running locally
If you want to host an instance of Linkr on your own server, or test it locally, you can clone the git repo
`git clone https://github.com/adamtherookie/linkr` and start the server after changing into the root directory of the project `python manage.py runserver`.

Requires python and the Django, Beautiful Soup, and markdown modules.
